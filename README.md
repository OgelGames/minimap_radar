## Overview

A simple extension to Minetest Game's `map` mod, this mod adds a single craftable item, that when placed in a player's inventory, enables the use of the radar mode of the minimap.

## Usage

1. Craft (or give yourself) the Radar item (see crafting below).
2. Place the Radar item anywhere in your inventory.
3. Use the **Minimap** key to toggle the minimap on, and switch between modes.

Note that the Radar item also enables the surface mode of the minimap, which means you don't need to carry a Mapping Kit in your inventory if you have a Radar item.

## Crafting

The crafting recipe for the Radar item changes depending on which mods are installed:

- Minetest Game only:
